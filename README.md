# DDoS Attack Classification
The DDoS attacks are the most destructive attacks that interrupt the safe operation of essential services delivered by the internet community's different organizations. DDOS stands for Distributed Denial Of Service attacks. These attacks are becoming more complex and expected to expand in number day after day, rendering detecting and combating these threats challenging. The goal is be able to predict whether a given packet is part of a DDoS Attack

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [DDOS Attack Network Logs](https://www.kaggle.com/jacobvs/ddos-attack-network-logs) from Kaggle. The dataset contains around 2,100,000 labelled network logs from various types of network attacks. The types of network attacks logged are:


<br>

**1. UDP-Flood** 
<br>

**2. Smurf** 
<br>

**3.  SIDDOS** 
<br>

**4. HTTP-FLOOD** 
<br>

**5. Normal**

## Model(s) Used

This needs to be a description of the model used and a brief overview of how it works in theory (e.g taken of a CNN Model):
